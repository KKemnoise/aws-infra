## 📡 Networking Architecture Plan – AWS Microservices Platform

## 🔧 Objective

Design and implement a secure, scalable, and multi-account AWS network architecture to support a Kubernetes-based microservices platform, following best practices in isolation, governance, and connectivity.

⸻

## 🧱 Core Principles
	•	Account-level isolation for environments and critical infrastructure
	•	Centralized network management through a shared Network account
	•	Private-by-default communication between services
	•	Controlled cross-account access using Transit Gateway and IAM
	•	Scalable VPC layout across multiple Availability Zones

⸻

## 🗂 Account Structure

Account Name	Purpose
Management	IAM, billing, governance, control plane
Network	Shared Transit Gateway, VPCs, peering
App (EKS)	Runs the microservices via EKS
Data	Hosts PostgreSQL (RDS/Aurora)
Security	Logging, auditing, threat detection


⸻

## 🌐 VPC Design

Each account contains one or more VPCs. Key configurations:

🔸 App Account (EKS)
	•	VPC with public subnets (for ALB, ingress) and private subnets (for pods)
	•	Routes to Transit Gateway for cross-account DB access
	•	Security Groups allow only egress to specific destinations (RDS SG)

🔸 Data Account (RDS/Aurora)
	•	VPC with private subnets only (multi-AZ)
	•	No internet access
	•	Routes to Transit Gateway to accept requests from App account
	•	RDS SG accepts inbound 5432 traffic only from EKS Node SG

🔸 Network Account
	•	Hosts AWS Transit Gateway (TGW)
	•	TGW is shared across all workload accounts via AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM)
	•	Central point to manage and audit network flow

⸻

## 🔁 Cross-Account Communication

🌉 Transit Gateway Setup
	•	TGW resides in Network Account
	•	Attachments from App and Data VPCs are created
	•	Route tables in both VPCs forward traffic for the peer VPC’s CIDR to the TGW

🔐 Security Groups and NACLs
	•	App account’s EKS Node SG allows egress to RDS
	•	Data account’s RDS SG allows ingress only from EKS Node SG
	•	Optional NACLs enforce deny rules for untrusted CIDRs

⸻

## 🛡 Security and Isolation
	•	No direct internet access to backend workloads or databases
	•	IAM roles with trust policies enforce who can assume access roles
	•	VPC Flow Logs and CloudTrail enabled for all accounts
	•	GuardDuty in the Security account monitors traffic

⸻

## 🗺 Future Scaling
	•	Add new EKS clusters or microservices by attaching new VPCs to TGW
	•	Create staging/test accounts with same TGW attachment logic
	•	Use Service Control Policies (SCPs) to enforce allowed network behavior

⸻

## ✅ Summary

This networking architecture provides a strong foundation to:
	•	Support production-grade microservices across isolated environments
	•	Scale connectivity securely using Transit Gateway
	•	Maintain visibility and control through centralized networking and IAM

By using this model, Innovate Inc. can operate and grow their cloud-native workloads with confidence and compliance.
